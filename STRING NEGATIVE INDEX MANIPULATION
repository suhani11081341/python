trick to manipulate negative index of a string

let us assume 
 
>>> x="suhani rastogi"
>>> len (x)
14
>>> x[0-len(x)]
's'
>>> x[0]
's'
notice the important relation to find the negative index of astring if you know its postive index

let us say
x[0]=s
now we will be finding the negative index of x[0]
will be
oringial postive index - len(x)=0-14=-14
so x[0]=x[-14]"s"
